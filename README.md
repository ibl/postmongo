postmongo
=========

Client-side javascript mongo. The goal is to enable a within-browser operation of mongodb with a syntax as close as possible as what is supported by mongodb's own mongo client application. 

Note postmongo relies exclusively on POST calls through node services such as postmongo.herokuapp.com. Therefore, those services provide a ***HTTP API to mongodb*** which is not RESTful.
